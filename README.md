# Yui Hirasawa [![Discord](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/382725233695522816/embed.png)](https://discord.gg/Bkh4F5W)
Yui Hirasawa is a multi-modular Discord bot made in the [Eris](https://abal.moe/Eris) library.

## Installation
Since Yui is tedious to install, I won't help nor will the Discord server. But if you desperately need to, you'll need to credit me (August) or a request of takedown will be put into action. | You must read and agree to the `Apache 2.0` license. Your instance of Yui must also be open-source.

You will need:
```
Node.js - The Bot's runtime enviroment.
Git - To clone the git repository.
RethinkDB - Our Database.

Some API keys:
    DiscordBotList API 
        - This is optional, if the bot doesn't have it, it won't upload.
    DiscordBots API 
        - This is optional, if the bot doesn't have it, it won't upload.
    BotList API
        - This is optional.
    Terminal API
        - This is optional.
    YouTube API
        - The music category will not be enabled if the API key isn't set.
    osu! API 
        - The osu! command will not be enabled if the API key isn't set.
```
        
We do provide a Dockerfile but that installation process will be soon:tm:.  
If you need general bot support, you may join the Discord server.
